  <description brief="ros integration of teer">
	High-level executive using teer, the task execution environment for robotics,
    from ETHZ ASL. Teer is a Python library proposing the use of co-routines
	(called tasks) to implement executives. Teer is an alternative to executives 
	based on state machines such as smach. This package extends teer with
	ROS-based time and protects teer tasks using a threading.Condition.
